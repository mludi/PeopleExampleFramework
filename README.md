# People Framework

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

This is an example framework for iOS

[Carthage](https://github.com/carthage/carthage) is the recommended way to install People. Add the following to your Cartfile:

```ruby
github "mludi/PeopleExampleFramework"
```

For manual installation, I recommend add the project as a subproject to your project or workspace and adding the framework as a target dependency.

## Usage

```swift
import People

let person = Person(name: "mludi")
```

Enjoy.
